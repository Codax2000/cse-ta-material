    "This notebook is for extra practice with `Seaborn` and `scikit-learn`. We will be using a couple of different datasets from the `vega-datasets` library. If you don't know what that is, it's fine - it's just a library with some really nice practice datasets to use. This challenge does not have any tests, as it's partly to help you explore what you can do with `seaborn`, but you can compare your plots visually to the examples shown. Please look at the documentation and see what other cool plots you can come up with!   \n",
